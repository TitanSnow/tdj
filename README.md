# tdj
A judge tool
## How to build
First of all, clone it

	git clone https://github.com/TitanSnow/tdj.git
	cd tdj

Next, make two dirs

	mkdir build
	mkdir bin

Then make it

	make

### For Windows
Install Cygwin including gcc, g++, make and git, then all things will go as same as Linux. 

For a bug of unknown origin, please turn off optimization. (-O0)

We cannot run robustly on Windows with Cygwin. Maybe a VM is better choice.
